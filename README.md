# Pimview Frontend

This project is the front end to "pimview",
A modular IOT POC leveraging a message broker architecture with modular subs that can translate to any iot device that isnt natively compatible with mqtt.

Additionally the idea was that the front end could also publish to broker where iot devices compatible with mqtt natively integrate
